Persuader:
1)	Strategy side
i)	appeal
1.	logical-appeal
Logical appeal refers to persuading others by using logical arguments. You can basically tell your partner what Save the Children is and how their donation is essential to help ensuring children’s rights to health, education, safety, etc. Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world. Statistics and evidence can be used to support the argument.
-	‘your donation will make their life better.’

2.	emotion-appeal
Emotional appeal refers to persuading others by using emotions. It refers to the elicitation of specific emotions to influence others. Specifically, we identified four emotional appeals:~1) telling stories to involve participants, 2) eliciting empathy, 3) eliciting anger, and 4) eliciting the feeling of guilt.
-	‘Kids are dying from hunger every minute.’

3.	Credibility-appeal
credibility-appeal, usually Happens after user ask-org-info, refers to the uses of credentials and citing organizational impacts to establish credibility and earn the persuadee's trust. The information usually comes from an objective source (e.g., the organization's website or other well-established websites).
Different from  7. Donation-Information, this one is about the organization’s fact, instead of how the donation will be sent.
-	‘it’s an international organization…’
-	‘I searched it online, it’s ranked No.3 among all organizations…’

4.	foot-in-the-door
aims at getting a person to agree to a large request by having them agree to a small request first. refers to the strategy of starting with small donation requests to facilitate compliance followed by larger requests  For instance, a persuader first asks for a smaller donation and extends the request to a larger amount after the persuadee shows intention to donate.
-	Example:
‘even $0.1 would help’

-	Exception
Note! Only when it’s used to persuade the partner to donate a small amount, it can be ‘foot-in-the-door’,  e.g. the sentence ‘even little bits can go a long way’ is not foot-in-the-door in the following example,
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Persuader: It's for a great cause.
Persuader: Children are the future and unfortunately too many of them don't get the quality of life that we take advantage of today.
Persuader: Sometimes we're in a better place and we have to do what we can to help their conditions a little bit.
Persuader: Even little bits can go a long way, you know?(NOT foot-in-the-door!)
Persuadee: it does, and charities can go further with the amount of money donated.

role-model, social pressure, usually happens after persuade ask-for-donation-intention but can also happen in other occasions  as a strategy. refers to the strategy where the persuader first indicates his or her own intention to donate and chooses to act as a role model for the persuadee to follow.
- ‘I will also match your donation’
- ‘I will also donate.’

6.	personal-Story

-	‘how much do you think i should donate’

ii)	inquiry
8.	source-related-inquiry
asks if the persuadee is aware of the organization (i.e., the source in our specific donation task). Can happen in the beginning or in the middle or in the end, which will be an important factor to divide the dialogue to two parts.
-	‘have you heard of ‘save the children’’
-	‘do you know about ‘save the children’’


9.	task-related-inquiry
asks about the persuadee's opinion and expectation related to the task, such as their interests in knowing more about the organization. non-personal, ask interests in the organization, ask task-related information (not as strong and explicit as propose-donation)
